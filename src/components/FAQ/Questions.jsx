        <p>Don&apos;t worry, by looking at your car usage together we can determine which plan is the best choice for you.</p>
        <p>Send us a message and we will get started for you right away.</p>

    question: "How often should you polish a car?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          We recommend that you have your car thoroughly cleaned at least once a month . This prevents musty odors, stains in the
          upholstery and the ingress of bird droppings, among other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintaining your own car is not possible for everyone. It takes a lot of time and energy. That is why a Cardetail Plan
          is useful in these kinds of situations.
        </p>

    question: "Can I also have another car cleaned?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>If only it were that much of a party, but unfortunately our CarDetail Plans are being registered.</p>
        <p>
          Because we first provide the car on the Plan with a deep cleaning, the maintenance is what you ultimately pay for. You
          can have another car detailed for an additional fee, to surprise your girlfriend this time ðŸ˜‰,
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "I am going to buy another car, can the plan be transferred?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>Of course. When buying a new car, we continue according to plan.</p>
        <p>We will change the license plate that is registered with us and will maintain the new car from now on.</p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to be at a fixed address for every cleaning?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          Very convenient, but not mandatory. If you are in our working area (Amsterdam and surroundings) It does not matter. We
          come where you are.
        </p>
        <p>We will note your permanent address, so if we need to be somewhere else on the cleaning day, please let us know.</p>
      </>

  {
    question: "I want to cancel my CarDetail Plan, how do I do that?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>An email I hope I will never receive. But before cancelling, send us an email with the reason for leaving.</p>
        <p>
          Because it can be cancelled monthly, you are not committed to anything, but we would like to know what the reason was
          for you, so that we can work on that in the future.
